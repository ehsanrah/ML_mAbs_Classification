In this project I used three different algorithm of
	1) random forrest
	2) decission tree
	3) support vector machine
to classify, the absorption properties of monoclonal antibodies based on the injecton device and injection site.
The data of absorption is taken form the following paper:

Zou, P., Wang, F., Wang, J., Lu, Y., Tran, D., & Seo, S. K. (2021). Impact of injection sites on clinical pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered peptides and proteins. Journal of Controlled Release, 336, 310-321.
